why we need arrays
---------------------------------
--> We need arrays in Java to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable,
    enabling efficient management and access of related data.

what is the syntax of arrays?
---------------------------------

--> data_type[] variable = new data_type[size];

    eg) store five value in single variable.

        int[] arr = new int[5];

        OR,

        int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};

        int[] arr --> it is the only declaration of the array at this time no array object created in memory.
                      it only define that "arr" is a reference variable which points to the integer array.
                      this happens at runtime.

        new int[5] --> here new keyword allocate the memory and int[] specify that it stores only integer value.
                       this happend at memory allocation time.
                       it creating the object in the heap memory.
                       this thing happens at runtime(dynamic memory allocation).

Note:: In java array object is may not be continuous it depends on jvm.

Note:: New is used to create an object in heap memory.
