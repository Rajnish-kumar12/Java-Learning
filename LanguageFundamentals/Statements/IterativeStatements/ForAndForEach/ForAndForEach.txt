--> In java applications if we know the number of iterations over the loop body in advance before writting the loops
    there we have to use for loop.

    Ex: If we want to read elements from an array there we have to use "for" loop.
        int[] a = {1,2,3,4,5};
        Size: a.length = 5; start index:0 and end index is :4.
    
        for(int i = 0;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            sop(a[i]);
        }
NOTE: 1) we must declare a seperate variable for looping purppose.
      2) At each and every iteration we must execute a conditional expression.
      3) At each and every iteration we must perform loop variable incrementation or decrementation operation.
      4) In above approach we are able to get array element by providing index value explicitely in this case
         there may be a chance to get array index out of bound exception.

To overcome this problems, JDK1.5 version has provided an enhancement over the for loop that is for-each loop.
Syntax:
for(Array_Data_Type var_name:Array_Ref_var)
{
    ------instruction------
}
Ex:
int[] a = {1,2,3,4,5};
for(int x:a)
{
    sop(x);
}

Note: for-each loop is applicable for retrieving elements from the arrays and from collection only, it is not applicable for
      normal iterations over the code.
