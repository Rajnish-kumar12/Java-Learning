                               Feature Part
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Describe Java Programming Languages nature, Java Programming Has Provided a set of features.

1) Simple.
2) Object Oriented.
3) Platform Independent.
4) Architectural Neutral.
5) Portable.
6) Robust.
7) Dynamic.
8) Secure.
9) Multithreaded.
10 Distributed.
11) Interpretive.
12) High Performance.

1) Simple Programming Language
................................

   --> Java Application are Simple Programming language because:

   	   -> It takes less memory and less execution time.
   	   -> It removes all the ambiguity or confusion related concepts like, pointers, multiple inheritance, operator overloading 
   	   	  etc.
   	   -> Java using all the simplified syntax from c and c++.

2) Object Oriented Programming Language
........................................

   --> Java is an object oriented programming language because, Java allows to represent data in the form of objects only, as per object 
   	   oriented features.

3) Platform Independent Programming Language
...............................................

   --> Java is platform independent programming language because it allows its applications to compile on one operating system and
   	   can execute on another operating systems.

4) Architectural Neutral Programming Language
................................................

   --> Java is architectural neutral programming language because it allows its application to perform compilation on one
   	   hardware system and perform execution on another hardware system.

5) Portable
.............

   --> Java is portable because, it allows its application to execute under all the operating systems and under all the hardware
   	   systems.

   --> Java is able to provide fixed memory allocations for the premitive data types irrerespective of the OS and the processor
   	   which we used.

6) Robust
...........

   --> Java is having very good memory management system in the form of heap memory management system, It is dynamic memory
   	   management system, It able to allocate and deallocate memory for the objects at runtime as per appliucation requirements.

   --> Java is provide very good predefined library for the exception handling.

7) Dynamic
.............

   --> Java is dynamic programming languages, Java allows memory allocations for premitive data type at run time, not at
   	   compilation time.

8) Secure
.............

   --> Java is Secure because java is very good at three level security.

   	   1) Implicit  Security : Security manager inside jvm.
   	   2) Web security : JAAS(Java Authentication and Authorization Services).
   	   3) Network Security : Java has provided predefined implementations for all network security algorithm which we are using
   	   						 frequently in java applications.

9) Multithreaded
..................

   --> Java is following multi threaded model, 	Java is able to provide very good environment to create  and execute more than
   	   one thread at a time.

10) Distributed
...................

	--> Java Distributed PL, because, Java has provided a seperated module to prepare Distrubuted Applications that is
		"J2EE/JAVA EE".

11) Interpretive
....................

	--> Java is both compilative and interpretive programming language:

		-> Java is compilative because to translate program from high level to machine code we use compiler, and to check
           developer syntax mistake also use compiler which find the error.

        -> Java interpreter is used to execute java applications, and iterpreter is inside "JVM", Hence java is interpretive.

12) High Performance
.......................

	--> It is rich set of feature like portable, robust, dynamic, distributed etc.
	--> Its internal components like JIT compiler inside jvm.
