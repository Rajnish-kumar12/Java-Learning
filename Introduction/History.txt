1) What was the exact requirement or need to introduce the Java programming language by Sun Microsystems?
2) What is the background story behind its development?

-> Java was first introduced on January 23, 1996.

-> In 1991, the creation of the Java programming language began. The goal was to develop software for electronic devices, such as cable TV set-top boxes 
	and remote controllers.
 
-> The name of the project was the "Green Project."

-> They wanted to include the following features in this new programming language:

	1) A simple programming language
	2) A tightly coded programming language
	3) An architecturally neutral programming language

1) Simple programming language:
   ............................

	-> Less execution time (higher performance)
	-> Less memory consumption (cost optimization)
	-> Less power consumption (cost optimization, less maintenance cost):

2) tight coded programming language
   ................................

	In C:
	a) push = 20 lines of code
	b) pop = 20 lines of code
	c) peek = 20 lines of code
	60 lines of code consumed

	But in Java, to perform stack operations, you can use the built-in Stack class:
	Stack s = new Stack();
	s.push();
	s.pop();
	s.peek();
	Here, it takes only 6 lines of code.

	Conclusion:
	If a programming language requires fewer lines of code to accomplish a particular complex task, it is called a tightly coded programming language. Conversely, if more lines of code are needed, it is called a loosely coded programming language.

	Hence, C is a loosely coded programming language, and Java is a tightly coded programming language.

3) Architecturally neutral programming language:
   .............................................

	-> An architectural neutral programming language is one that can run on any hardware platform or operating system without modification. The code written in such a language is independent of the 
		underlying system architecture.



	In December 1992, a new programming language was developed and named "Java."

	The coffee logo was inspired by Java, which is a place in Indonesia known for its large coffee production.

	The first product created using the Java programming language by Sun Microsystems was "Star-7," a remote controller, which ultimately turned out to be a failure.

	In 1994, the browser boom began.
	Sun Microsystems developed a browser in Java called HotJava Browser, which was completed in 1995. It was a successful product, and as a result, Sun Microsystems decided to launch the new programming language to the market, which happened in 1996.

	Java Development Kit (JDK) versions:

	JDK 1.0
	JDK 1.1
	JDK 1.2 (with more enhancements)
	JDK 1.3
	JDK 1.4
	JDK 1.5 (with more enhancements)
	Java 6
	Java 7
	Java 8 (with more enhancements, including lambda expressions)
	Java 9 (with more enhancements, including the module system - JPMS)
	Java 10
	Java 11, and so on...
	Up to Java 6, Java was managed by Sun Microsystems, and later versions are managed by Oracle.
