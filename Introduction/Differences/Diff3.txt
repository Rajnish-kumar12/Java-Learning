				3) PLATFORM DEPENDENT VS PLATFORM INDEPENDENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) C and C++ are platform-dependent programming languages, whereas Java is a platform-independent programming language.
   ....................................................................................................................

   --> First, we need to understand when a programming language is considered platform-dependent or platform-independent.

   ---> If a programming language allows its applications to be compiled and executed on the same operating system, then that programming language is called a platform-dependent programming language.
		  Example: C and C++ are platform-dependent programming languages.

   Steps of Compilation and Execution in C and C++:
   ________________________________________________

	  Writing the Code: Writing the source code in a .c or .cpp file.
	  Preprocessing: Expanding directives like #include and #define.  
	  Compilation: Converting the expanded code into assembly code.
	  Assembly: Translating assembly code into machine code (object code).
	  Linking: Combining object code and libraries to create an executable file.
	  Execution: Running the executable file on the operating system.


   .c(c program) --> compilation --> .exe(executable file in the form of 01010101) --> execution(c-engine) --> output
   						windows                                                             windows

    An .exe file contains directly executable code and has a Windows-specific representation. For execution, it requires a Windows execution engine. If Linux is used instead of Windows as the operating system, the .exe file cannot be executed. This is why C and C++ are platform-dependent programming languages.


    ---> If a programming language allows its applications to be compiled on one operating system and executed on another operating system, then that programming language is called a 
    		platform-independent programming language.

   Steps of Compilation and Execution in JAVA
   ___________________________________________

   .java(java program) --> compilation .class(this file is not directly executable , intermediate code) -->  converter  -> jvm   -> output

			   																																					linux os

										   																												-->  converter  -> jvm   -> output

										   																														unix os																					

										   																												-->  converter  -> jvm   -> output

										   																														solaris os

										   															    													-->  converter  -> jvm   -> output

										   																														windows os

   	Note : Java software is platform-dependent, but the Java programming language is platform-independent. Applications developed using Java are platform-independent because of the JVM (Java Virtual
   			 Machine).

				 If there is a Linux JVM, it requires a Linux representation of the .class file. However, the JVM uses a converter to translate the .class file into the required Linux representation.

   	Q) what is the difference between .exe and .class file?

	   	.exe file is generates in c and c++ and .class file generates in java pl.
	   	.exe file able to product direct executable code but java doesnot provide direct executable code.
	   	.exe file is platform dependent file but .class file is platform independent file.
	   	.exe file is able to provide less security and .class file is able to provide more security.
