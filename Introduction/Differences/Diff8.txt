					8) CALL BY VALUE AND CALL BY REFERENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c and c++ are follow call by value and call by reference parameter passing mechanism, but, java is following only call by value parameter passing mechanism.

--> First we have to understand what is call by value and wht is call by reference

	 In any programming language, if we pass primitive data as parameters to the methods then the parameter passing mechnaism is called call by value.

	 Similarly, In any programming language address location as parameters to the methods then the parameter passing mechanism is call by reference.

--> In c and c++, If we pass pointer variable as parameters then it is called call by reference, In c and c++ pointer variable are able to 
	 store address location directly.
	 In case of java even if we pass object reference variable as parameters to the method then the parameter passing mechanism is call by value only not call by reference why because object reference 	 varibale is not storing address location, object reference variable is able to store the object reference value, where object reference value is hexa decimal form of hash code, where hashcode is 
         an unique identity provide by the heap manager in the form of an integer value.
