									 9) MEMORY ALLOCATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In c and c++, Integers will take 2 bytes of memory and character will take 1 bytes of memory, but, In java, Integers will take 4 bytes of memory and characters will takes 2 bytes of memory.

--> In c and c++, memory allocation for the premitive data type is not fixed, it is variable, it is depending on the operating system which 
	 we used.

--> In java, memory allocation for the premitive data type is fixed, its not depend on the operating system.

	 Byte   --> 1bytes
	 Short  --> 2bytes
	 Int    --> 4bytes
	 Long   --> 8bytes
	 Float  --> 4bytes
	 Double --> 8bytes
	 Char   --> 2bytes
	 Boolean--> 1bit

Q) In the c and c++, characters are able to take only 1 byte of memory then what is the requirement for java to assign 2 bytes of memory for 
	characters?

	--> In c and c++, all characters are represented in the form of ascii values, and for ascii values 1 byte of memory is sufficient but in
		 case of java all the characters are represented in the form of UNICODE representation and for unicode 2 byte of memory is sufficient.

Q) What is UNICODE and what is its requirement in java?

	--> UNICODE representation is one the character representation, it able to represent all the alphabet from all the natural languages like
		 english,hindi,italian,etc.
		 with this represent it able to provide very good internationalization (i18n).

Q) What is the meaning i18n?

	--> Designing java application as per locale conventions is called internationalization.
