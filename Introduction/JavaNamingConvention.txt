eg : a != A.

1) All classes name, abstract classes name, interface name , enums name must started with uppercase letter, also subsequent letter must
   started with uppercase letter.

   eg : String

2) All varibales name started with small case letter and subsequent letter started should be uppercase letter.

   eg : in, out, err

3) All methods name started with lowercase letter and subsequent letter must started with uppercase letter.

	eg : concat();
		 forName();
		 getInputStream();

4) All constant name must be in upper case letter.
	eg : MIN_PRIORITY;

		 NORM_PRIORITY;

5) All java packages name must be provided in lowercase letter.
